                <p>For the past 8 years, I have worked in the field of finance, but at night, I have been programming websites. Through that process, I realized that coding those websites was what I was ultimately most passionate about. As I taught myself through trial and error, I found that there was nothing more satisfying than getting a complicated piece of code to work just like I wanted it to. My goal is to become a successful developer helping to create the applications of tomorrow.</p>
                <h3 class="fullright">My Family</h3>
                <div class="imgandp">

                    <p>Nothing is more important to me than my family. My son Grant was born in 2014 and he is my life. Although I enjoy coding, there is nothing like coming home to his smiling face!</p>
                    <p>My wife Kathleen and I also have two amazing dogs, Lucy and Gus. We definitely have a busy household!</p>

                    <p>In addition to coding, I am also a musician. I play trumpet, guitar, piano, and drums.  I also sing tenor and have performed with many choirs including The Louisville Chorus, Christ Church Cathedral Choir, and St Francis of Rome Holiday Schola.</p>
                </div>
                <p>I have been associated with Menswork Inc. for about 4 years now. Our mission is to eliminate all forms of violence against women. It has been rewarding watching a startup nonprofit grow and affect change.</p>
                <p>In addition to Menswork, I can typically be found at various fundraisers around town and enjoy freezing every February when I take the Polar Bear Plunge into the Ohio River to benefit Special Olympics.</p>
                <h3 class="fullright">Work Preferences</h3>
                <div class="imgandp">
                    <p>I consider myself very flexible when it comes to how I work and what I work on. I enjoy being challenged, learning on the fly, and creating solutions. Working well in a group or on my own, I can effectively get the job done in a number of different ways. Goal-oriented, I prefer to set manageable benchmarks for myself and then do everything to achieve them.</p>
