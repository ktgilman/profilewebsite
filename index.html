                <p>I am an aspiring developer with nearly 10 years of experience coding as a hobby. My goal is to make programming my career. This website is meant to give you an idea of my coding skills and an insight into how I would fit in your team. I believe that I will add to your team not only because I can code, but also because of my skills in communication, problem solving and multi-tasking.</p>

                <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>Most of my knowledge is from self-discovery as I attempted projects throughout the years.  I have included a sample of recent projects <a href="portfolio.html">here</a> if you would like to see my coding in action. Starting in January 2015, I began also learning through Code Louisville. Here are the languages/libraries I am comfortable with and my skill level in each:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML : <span class="comfort vc">Very Comfortable</span></li>
                    <li>CSS : <span class="comfort c">Comfortable</span></li>
                    <li>Javascript : <span class="comfort c">Comfortable</span></li>
                    <li>JQuery : <span class="comfort c">Comfortable</span></li>
                    <li>PHP : <span class="comfort c">Comfortable</span></li>
                    <li>MySQL : <span class="comfort c">Comfortable</span></li>
                    <li>C# : <span class="comfort sc">Somewhat Comfortable</span></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>In my experience, I have been able to perfect my communication skills. The way I like to explain this is: It doesn't matter what you say, it matters what your listener hears and comprehends. When it comes to working in teams, the smallest misunderstanding can lead to added time, energy, and cost. I take the time to ensure understanding, thus avoiding problems before they exist.</p>
